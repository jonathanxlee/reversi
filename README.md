# Reversi

This is a basic reversi web-app that runs on node.js. Reversi is the same game as Othello or Go and I built this to gain a better understanding of developing a web application. 

## Playing the Game

To play the game you can go to this [link](https://reversi-jxl.herokuapp.com/) and play it on any browser. Additionally, you can clone or download the repo an take the following actions to be able to run it locally. 

1. Navigate to the directory and in the terminal and enter `npm install`

2. Start the server with `node server.js`

3. Open localhost:8080/index.html in any browser.
